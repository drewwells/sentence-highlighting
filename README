Sentence highlighting
================================

Page hash links to paragraphs and individual sentences.  Also, highlights sentences within the paragraph.  The usage is knock off of NYT's implementation [http://thenextweb.com/media/2010/12/02/the-new-york-times-introduces-the-evolution-of-the-hyperlink/]

Usage
--------------

* http://example.com/index.html#p2: scrolls to the second paragraph
* http://example.com/index.html#p2s2: scrolls to the second sentence of the paragraph, line depends on the length of the first sentence
* http://example.com/index.html#h2s2: scrolls like **`p2s2'** but also highlights this sentence.

This functionality only occurs on page load, just like the NYT's implementation.  I still need to add some graphics and functionality for the double shit like described in the above url.
